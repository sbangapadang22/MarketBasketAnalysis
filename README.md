# Market Basket Analysis
### Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository: Online Retail Data Set

### Goals:
1. **Data Collection:** Acquire a comprehensive dataset of retail transactions. This could be real-world data from a partner retail store or a publicly available dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and converting transaction data into a suitable format for mining algorithms.
3. **Implementation of Mining Algorithms:** Implement the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms to extract frequent itemsets from the transaction data.
4. **Analysis of Association Rules:** Generate and evaluate association rules from frequent itemsets. Focus on metrics like support, confidence, and lift to assess the strength and relevance of these rules.
5. **Visualization:** Develop visualizations to present the findings effectively. Use heatmaps, network graphs, or bar charts to show common itemsets and the strength of associations.
6. **Optimization and Testing:** Optimize the parameters of the mining algorithms for better performance and accuracy. Test the system with different subsets of data to evaluate its robustness.

### Dependencies:
```
{
import pip mlxtend
}

### How to run (in order):
```
{
    python src/preprocessing.py
    python src/apriori_analysis.py 
    python src/fpgrowth_analysis.py
}
```

After getting the frequent itemsets and association rules generated by the mining algorithms, we can now analyze and evaluate these rules.
